                    <p>Hailey's healthy glowing skin raises expectations for Rhode. The term glazed donut, used for bright and smooth skin appearance, inspires Rhode. Bieber, who received insight from industry giants during the development phase of his brand and tried many care products himself, says that he continues to use products with affordable prices and strong formulas, which is why he shaped Rhode with this understanding. Rhode will start its journey with serum, mask, moisturizer and many other basic care products.</p>

                    <p>“I want skin that looks like you want to take a bite out of it. That’s just me, though!” Hailey Bieber says with a laugh. “Who doesn’t want fresh, dewy, glowy skin? Hydration never goes out of style.”</p>

                    <p>Why did Hailey name her skincare Rhode? After considering a line inspired by her marital surname, the model has reportedly turned to her middle name Rhode (her full name is Hailey Rhode Baldwin Bieber) for her latest business venture. It's a move that her husband made when creating his fashion label Drew House, taking inspiration from his middle name Drew.</p>
