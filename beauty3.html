                    <p>The packaging designs are designed in a hexagonal shape, inspired by honeycomb. First of all, Fenty Beauty's packaging and products are produced with great care and high quality. Thanks to the hexagonal magnetic design, all products can be interlocked with each other. This means convenience and elegance both on the make-up table and in the make-up bag.</p>
