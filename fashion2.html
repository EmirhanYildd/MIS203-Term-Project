                    <p>Combining tights with blazers has been popular in the fashion world for a long time. Finally, Hailey Bieber was seen on the streets of Los Angeles wearing an oversize padded blazer paired with ballerina tights from Wardrobe NYC. As for her shoe choice, she chose thin low-heeled shoes and completed her outfit with a Saint Laurent tote bag. Although she looked like a businesswoman from the 80s with her straight hair and gold earrings, she added a more modern look to her style with her ballerina tights. </p>

                    <p>Considering that ballerina tights also came to the fore with the balletcore trend, we can say that they are a much more sophisticated interpretation, unlike ordinary tights. The most elegant touch to Bieber's outfit is with Toteme's pointed toe short heels. Low heels, which are also one of the popular shoe trends of recent times, add a more modern atmosphere to the outfit.</p>
