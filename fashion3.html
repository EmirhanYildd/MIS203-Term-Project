                    <p>Rihanna's first F1 look featured a long brown leather jacket with utility panels from Prada's spring 2024 collection. To balance this, she piled her style with diamond accessories that would make her more evening-ready. The next day, the superstar continued her focus on leather with a second race-inspired look. After all, F1 drivers wear leather too. She wore an oversized biker jacket from Balenciaga's spring 2024 collection and paired it with Demna's signature Pantaboots and futuristic Ambush sunglasses.</p>
