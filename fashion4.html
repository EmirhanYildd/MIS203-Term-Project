                    <p>How stylish should you dress when going to dinner in Los Angeles? Selena Gomez seems to have found the perfect balance in this regard. Selena, whom we encounter while entering a restaurant, displays a careless and comfortable elegance in her satin slip dress from the Reformation label. The shoe choice of the beautiful star, who makes a statement with her sexy high slit, is Francesco Russo's burgundy stilettos called D'Orsay. </p>

                    <p>Showing effortless elegance with this pair, Selena elevates her style with the Coach jacket, which is the key piece of her look. The signature detail of the brand's design, which is not yet on sale, is on the back. Combining two different portraits in the same outfit with her characterful jacket, Selena Gomez shows us again that she deserves the title of style icon.</p>
