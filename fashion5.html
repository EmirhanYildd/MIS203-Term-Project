                        <p>Recently, Kylie Jenner was seen leaving a meeting wearing a short white undershirt and a Dolce & Gabbana indigo blue tights-skirt that covered her ankles completely. Jenner is still sticking to the quiet luxury trend she adopted this summer. Appearing in mini dresses and minimal heels throughout the summer, Jenner brings back the skirt and tights trend that was popular in the 2000s. She completed her outfit with MM6 high heels and a black leather shoulder bag.</p>

                        <p>Jenner, on the other hand, wore a nude Atlein dress with opaque white pantyhose and strappy sandals a week ago. She looks like she's going to attend a dance recital with her outfit, which again refers to the balletcore movement. She chose 2 different bags as accessories. The first was Bottega Veneta's tote bag and the other was a super small white bag.</p>
